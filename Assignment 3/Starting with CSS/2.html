    <h1><u>About CSS</u></h1>
    <p>
        CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written
        in HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology of the web and plays a crucial role in designing visually appealing and engaging web pages.

        CSS allows web developers to control the presentation aspects of a webpage, such as the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other 
        visual properties. It provides a set of rules and selectors that define how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen or printed.
