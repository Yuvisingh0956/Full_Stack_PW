List any  5 semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions.

Sure! Here are five semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions:

1. `<header>`: The `<header>` tag represents the introductory or navigational section of a document or a section within a document. 
It typically contains the site or section title, logo, navigation menus, and other introductory content.

2. `<nav>`: The `<nav>` tag is used to define a section of a document that contains navigation links. 
It is intended for major navigation blocks, such as a primary menu or a table of contents.

3. `<main>`: The `<main>` tag specifies the main content of a document. It should contain the central content that is unique 
to the document and not include any content that is repeated across a set of documents, such as site-wide navigation or copyright information.

4. `<article>`: The `<article>` tag defines a self-contained composition within a document, such as a blog post, a news article, 
a forum post, or a user comment. It should make sense on its own and be distributable independently from the rest of the content.

5. `<footer>`: The `<footer>` tag represents the closing or concluding section of a document or a section within a document. 
It typically contains information such as copyright notices, author information, links to related documents, and other auxiliary content.
