List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML


Improving the accessibility of HTML involves making web content more inclusive and usable for individuals with disabilities. 

Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. Proper Semantic Structure: Using proper HTML semantic elements is crucial for accessibility. 
Semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` provide a clear and
meaningful structure to the content. They help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the purpose and
relationships between different parts of a web page. By structuring content semantically, you make it easier for 
individuals with disabilities to navigate and comprehend the information.

2. Alternative Text for Images: Providing alternative text (alt text) for images is essential for users who cannot see the images. 
Alt text describes the content and purpose of an image, allowing screen readers to convey the information to visually impaired users.
By using descriptive and concise alt text, you ensure that individuals who rely on screen readers can understand the context and 
meaning conveyed by the images on your website.

3. Proper Form Labeling: When creating HTML forms, it's important to use proper labeling techniques. 
Labels provide descriptive text for form elements, allowing users to understand the purpose and function of each field. 
Associating labels with their corresponding form elements using the `for` attribute or by wrapping the input element 
with the `<label>` element ensures that individuals using assistive technologies can easily identify and complete form fields. 
This is particularly important for users who rely on screen readers or have mobility impairments.
