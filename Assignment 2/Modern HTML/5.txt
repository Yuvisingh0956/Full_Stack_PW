Write a short note on the tab index.

The `tabindex` attribute is used in HTML to specify the order in which elements are focused when navigating through a 
web page using the keyboard's Tab key. It allows developers to control the tabbing behavior and ensure a logical and 
intuitive keyboard navigation experience for users.

Here are a few key points to note about the `tabindex` attribute:

1. Default Tab Order: By default, the tab order follows the sequence in which elements appear in the HTML source code. 
Block-level elements, such as `<div>` or `<p>`, are focused before inline elements like `<span>` or `<a>`. 
The `tabindex` attribute can be used to modify this order.

2. Positive and Negative Values: The `tabindex` attribute accepts both positive and negative integer values. 
Positive values indicate that an element can receive keyboard focus and specify the order in which elements are tabbed. 
Lower values are focused first, with the value of 1 being the earliest. Elements with the same `tabindex` value are 
focused in the order they appear in the HTML.

Negative values, on the other hand, remove an element from the default tab order. Elements with a `tabindex` of -1 
cannot be focused using the Tab key but can still be programmatically focused using JavaScript.

3. Focusable Elements: Not all elements are naturally focusable. By default, interactive elements like `<a>`, `<button>`, 
and `<input>` are focusable, allowing users to interact with them using the keyboard. Other elements, like `<div>` or `<span>`, 
are not naturally focusable but can become focusable by assigning a positive `tabindex` value.

4. Skippable Elements: In some cases, developers may want to exclude certain elements from the tab order, 
such as decorative or repetitive elements. By assigning a `tabindex` value of -1 to these elements, they can be 
effectively skipped during keyboard navigation, ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience.
