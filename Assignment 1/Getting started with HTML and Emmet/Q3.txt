Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along with relevant examples.

Tags:
In web development, tags are used to define the structure and appearance of content in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. 
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("< >") and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display and interpret the content. 
They are fundamental building blocks of HTML documents.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>

In the above example, the `<p>` tag represents a paragraph element. The text "This is a paragraph tag." is the content of the paragraph.

Elements:
Elements are made up of tags and the content they enclose. They define the structure and semantics of the document. 
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements may not have any content and are self-closing.

Example:
<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

In this example, the `<h1>` tag represents a heading element. The text "Welcome to my website!" is the content of the heading.

Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are included within the opening tag and help define the behavior,
 appearance, or other characteristics of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign ("=").

Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">

In this example, the `<img>` tag represents an image element. The `src` attribute specifies the image source file ("image.jpg"), 
and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text that describes the image ("A beautiful sunset").
