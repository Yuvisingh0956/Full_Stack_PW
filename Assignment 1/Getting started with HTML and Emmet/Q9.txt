What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags?

Self-closing tags, also known as empty tags or void elements, are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag because they do not 
contain any content or children. They represent elements that are self-contained and do not have any textual or structural content 
associated with them. Instead, they may carry attributes to provide additional information or functionality.

Meta tags can be used to control how search engines index and display a webpage, set the language of the document, specify the 
character encoding, add viewport settings for responsive design, and include other metadata relevant to the webpage.
