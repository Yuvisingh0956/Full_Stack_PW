List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags.

1. <a> Tag (Anchor Tag):
The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks in HTML. It allows you to link to other web pages, files, sections within the same page, or 
external resources. The href attribute is used to specify the URL or destination of the link.

2. <img> Tag (Image Tag):
The <img> tag is used to insert images into an HTML document. It does not have a closing tag and is considered a self-closing tag. 

3. <p> Tag (Paragraph Tag):
The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text in HTML. It represents a block-level element and is commonly used to structure and 
organize textual content on a web page.
