List out the features of HTML5.

1. Semantic elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and more. 
These elements provide a clearer structure and meaning to web page content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to 
understand and interpret the page.

2. Multimedia support: HTML5 includes built-in support for multimedia elements such as `<audio>` and `<video>`. With HTML5, you can embed audio
and video content directly into web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas element: The `<canvas>` element allows dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and images using JavaScript. 
It provides a drawing API that gives developers greater control over creating and manipulating graphical content within the browser.

4. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 includes native support for SVG, a markup language for creating vector graphics. 
SVG allows for the creation of scalable and interactive graphics directly in HTML, offering resolution-independent images that can be styled and 
scripted using CSS and JavaScript.

5. Geolocation: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that enables websites to request and access a user's geographic location. 
This feature is useful for location-based services, mapping applications, and other location-aware web applications.

6. Local storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's 
device. This enables offline functionality, faster access to cached resources, and the ability to store user preferences and data for future visits.

7. Web Workers: HTML5 supports the use of Web Workers, which are separate background scripts that run concurrently with the main page's JavaScript 
execution. Web Workers allow for multi-threaded processing, enabling complex calculations and tasks to be offloaded to background threads, thereby 
improving performance and responsiveness.

8. WebSockets: HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, which enables bidirectional communication between a web browser and a server over a single,
long-lived connection. WebSockets provide a more efficient and responsive alternative to traditional HTTP polling or long-polling techniques, 
making real-time applications, such as chat applications or collaborative editing tools, easier to develop.

9. Form enhancements: HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., email, date, number, range, etc.), attributes (e.g., required, pattern, placeholder, 
etc.), and form validation capabilities. These enhancements simplify form handling, improve user experience, and reduce the reliance on JavaScript
for basic validation.

10. Accessibility improvements: HTML5 includes various accessibility features, such as native support for
 ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which help make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. 
 The semantic elements and improved structure also contribute to better accessibility.
